            <p>In this experiment, you will be presented with three images on each trial:</p>
            
            <p>- One target image will appear at the bottom of the screen<br>
               - Two option images will appear on the left and right sides</p>
            
            <p>Your task is to determine which of the two options (left or right) better matches the target image.
               Click on the option that you think is most similar to the target image.</p>
            
            <p>You can pause in between trials, but once you click on the cross icon to start the next trial, 
               you have to respond as fast as possible. You will be given feedback after each selection.</p>
            
            <p>There will be 666 trials in total, presented in three blocks of 222 trials. 
               You are invited to take a longer break after 222 and 444 trials respectively.</p>
            
            <p>We will start with a practice session consisting of three trials.</p>
        </div>
        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <p>When you are ready, click the button to start the practice session.</p>
