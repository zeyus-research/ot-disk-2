            <p>At every trial, you will see six decorated discs.<br />

                5 out of 6 are exactly the same; only one disc is different; this is the "oddball".<br />
                
                You have to find the oddball as quick as possible and click on it.</p>  
                
                <p>You can pause in between trials, but once you click on the cross icon to start the next trial, you have to respond as fast as possible. You will be given feedback after each trial.<br />
                
                There will be 666 trials in total, presented in three blocks of 222 trials. You are invited to take a longer break after 222 and 444 trials respectively.<br />

                We will start with a practice session consisting of three trials.</p>
