                            This study seeks to track symbolic behavior and social networks among hunter-foragers during the Ice Age of western Europe (ca. 20,000 to 14,000 years ago). During this period, humans used symbols to encode social information onto objects, especially items of personal ornamentation. This study focuses on one type of these objects - small, perforated disks that were made from stone or bone. 

                            Your participation will benefit researchers in the project as well as a general audience from a diverse field interested in studies of human evolution. We aim to publish the results of the study in a high-profile international scientific journal.`,
